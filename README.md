# University-Admission-Form-2
TThis repository contains a web-based University Admission Form which was my Fifth Semester Final Project. The Project consists of two PHP files: "admission_form.php" and "process_form.php". The project aims to provide a simple and customizable solution for universities or educational institutions to collect admission information from prospective students.


Features:

1.	Admission Form:  The "admission_form.php" file presents an HTML form where applicants can enter their personal details, program choice, GPA, and a personal essay.
2.	Form Validation: The form includes basic client-side validation to ensure that all required fields are filled in before submission.
3.	Data Processing:  The "process_form.php" file processes the form data submitted by the applicants, retrieves the values, performs server-side validation, and provides the ability to further process the data according to specific requirements (e.g., storing in a database, sending emails).
4.	Data Display Example:  The provided example code in "process_form.php" demonstrates how to display the submitted form data on the server-side. However, it can be easily customized to perform other actions such as database insertion or email notifications.


Usage:

1.	Clone or download the repository to your web server.
2.	Configure the web server to execute PHP files.
3.	Access the "admission_form.php" file in a web browser to view the admission form.
4.	Applicants can fill in the form fields and submit their application.
5.	The form data will be processed by "process_form.php" and can be further customized to suit your specific needs.


Customization:

1.	Program Choices:  Customize the program choices in the "admission_form.php" file by modifying the <select> element's options to match your university's programs.
2.	Form Validation:  Enhance the form validation in both files to meet your specific requirements, such as additional field validation or implementing server-side validation.
3.	Data Processing:  Modify the "process_form.php" file to process the form data as needed, such as storing the data in a database, sending email notifications to the admissions team, or integrating with other systems.
